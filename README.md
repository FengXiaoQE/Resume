EMPLOYMENT 
2019.1-2025.8 Senior QE & Automation/Dominos Brisbane, Australia 
• Automation &E2E-Testing: Designed and maintained Playwright and WebDriverIO frameworks for web and mobile, 
supporting scalable E2E coverage across browsers and devices (BrowserStack, Appium). Automated API and 
backend validation with Postman/Insomnia and RestSharp/C#, including mock servers to simulate dependencies 
and reduce flakiness. 
• Performance & CI/CD Integration: Built E2E, integration, and performance test suites (k6, JMeter), integrated into 
Azure DevOps and Azure pipelines with automated triggers, monitored system and test metrics using New Relic 
and Grafana, reducing regression execution time and improving release confidence. 
• Cloud & Pipeline Deployment: Collaborated with DevOps to deploy automated tests across AWS (SNS, SQS, EC2/ECS, 
Lambda, S3, DynamoDB) and Azure (Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus, App Service, Storage, Key Vault) 
environments, ensuring scalable, reliable, cloud-native application testing. 
• AI-Powered Testing: Researched and applied AI-driven frameworks (MCP, Copilot, n8n) to optimize test generation, 
regression coverage, and bug detection; implemented AI-assisted browser testing, Jira reporting, service call 
diagram generation, and automated code creation for risk analysis. 
• Test Strategy & Quality Improvement: Defined test strategies, frameworks, and best practices, combining AIassisted analytics to enhance software quality; managed TeamCity configurations, test environments, and 
automated builds. 
• Agile Collaboration & Continuous Improvement: Partnered with cross-functional teams for story refinement, 
estimation, execution, and defect management; engaged in sprint ceremonies (planning, standups, retrospectives) 
and showcased automation to stakeholders for transparency and iterative improvements.

2017.4-2019.1 Quality Engineer & Automation/TattsGroup(Tabcorp) Brisbane, Australia 
• Drove end-to-end testing in Agile environments, refining user stories, defining acceptance criteria, and ensuring 
product quality through early collaboration with cross-functional teams. 
• Designed and implemented automated Web UI and backend API test flows using Selenium (C#, SpecFlow BDD), 
Postman, and mocked services, expanding regression coverage and reducing manual effort. 
• Developed Python automation scripts to validate SQL logic and device workflows, improving accuracy and 
reproducibility for complex backend-driven systems such as TattsRNG. 
• Coordinated integration testing across microservices, optimized automation scenarios, and facilitated showcase 
sessions to accelerate delivery cycles and improve system reliability. 
• Built and maintained TeamCity CI/CD pipelines and test environments, enabling automated build deployment, 
continuous testing, and streamlined release processes.
